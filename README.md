  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
  - **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building APIs.

- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing articles and user-generated content.

- **Authentication**: 
  - **Firebase Auth**: For secure user authentication and management.

- **Deployment**: 
  - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For hosting the application and ensuring scalability.

## Features

- **Dynamic Article Management**: Users can view articles, upvote them, and leave comments.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Firebase Auth.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic UI updates for a seamless interaction experience.
- **RESTful API**: Well-structured API endpoints for efficient data handling.
